# springBootProject

**Observation**

**-Retrieveing functionality based on time range, at particular date ,based on X days ago,based on X minutes ago has been implemented**

**-Updating functionality based on _field column, _value column, and tag column can be done**

**-Deleting functionality is challenging for me,only able to delete entire bucket or drop table.**

**Not enough resource available, to resolve influx Db error will be challenging for developers.
flux Table storage is different from SQL.**


**-Retrieveing functionality at at particular point of time (based on _time column ) can be done, but not able to implement...community page says it can be done (filtering a record based on particulat timestamp(_time))**
